            “I had been searching for a good business for six months prior to working with BTS.  Within a few weeks, we had contacted over 100 companies that were interested in a transaction.  Steve and his partners were great at sorting out the weak businesses from the strong ones.  We ended up making offers on six businesses, and I got the best one!  Steve was particularly gifted at working through tricky negotiations to ensure that I got a good deal.  BTS did such a great job, I have recommended them three times already!” - <strong>Rob Olney, President, ETM Manufacturing Company</strong>

            “A few months into a frustrating self-directed search, I was referred to BTS.  Their confidence and professionalism immediately won me over, so I took a leap of faith and signed on.  They promised to deliver real value and certainly kept their word.  I recommend anyone committed to acquiring their own small business to work with BTS.  They will find opportunities you would have never imagined, and then make deals happen when inevitable obstacles appear.  They protect your interests among sellers and selling agents who are only looking to close a transaction and collect a fee.  If the cost of BTS services is an issue, consider the cost of not finding a company to buy or ending up with a mediocre company.  BTS will pay for itself many times over by finding high quality candidates and structuring a deal in your best interest.  I am only a couple of weeks post-closing, but I am very happy with the company I have found and am optimistic with my future.”

          <p>“I spent the last 7 years of my corporate business career as division general manager for Fortune 500 corporations.  This experience has proven invaluable as I begin the day to day management of my own company.  However, nothing in my former business experience prepared me for the level of detail and the nuances of having to manage every aspect of a new business acquisition.  Without the support and counsel of Steve and Brehn Smith, I would not have known the sequence of steps including accessing potential acquisition targets, due diligence, selecting accounting and legal advice, securing financing and final negotiations required to complete my business acquisition.  The team at Business Transfers and Strategies worked tirelessly on my behalf.  I strongly recommend their services to anyone considering an acquisition.”

           “Business Transfers & Strategies provides the buyer with an effective solution to one of the most challenging steps in the process – finding the business that’s “not for sale” and bringing the owner to the table.  I found them to be responsive and diligent, working long and hard to sort through the candidates in order to help me find the right deal.”

         <p>“In just three weeks, BTS has proven to me that their system is the most effective way to find solid candidates for acquisition.  I have been put in touch with more strong prospects than I saw in months of contacting brokers and sifting through public listings.  And, because these businesses were not publicly listed for sale, I was put in touch directly with the owners – not brokers.  Add BTS’s experience and professionalism, and it’s not hard to see why I’m sold.”

           “I’ve always known Steve to be extremely thorough, conscientious, and honest in his work – whether is resulted in information that would be well-received or not.  Steve and I have had some frank discussions regarding business opportunities, including franchising, and he always was able to back up his findings with concrete, defensible information.  I would not hesitate in enlisting the assistance of BTS if a potential opportunity presents itself that I would like to consider.”

         <p>"BTS has the ability to sort through voluminous information to focus its clients on the issues presented.  BTS understands its clientele and provides the level of service needed in each particular case.  The follow-through and attention to detail provided by BTS speaks volumes as to the quality of the advice and resources devoted to each client.  At the end of the day, it is clear to me that BTS is solely focused on providing the best results to its clients."

           “Business Transfers & Strategies (BTS) brings top-notch professionalism, attention to detail, follow-up and overall deal-making experience and business savvy to every aspect of every deal.  Having worked with a number of business brokers in the past, I can say with confidence that BTS outshines them all by bringing considerably more to the table on behalf of each client on a consistent, day-to-day basis.  If you are someone even beginning to contemplate the purchase of a business, you need to contact them as early in the process as possible – your team is incomplete without BTS.”

           “I have worked on several acquisitions with Business Transfers and Strategies in the past two years. My experiences have been excellent.  They are real pros and work very hard for their clients.  Buyers and sellers of businesses often have very different tax, business and non-business objectives.  They are aware of these differences and have a knack of helping them to overcome many of the potential obstacles to insure that the deal works for both parties.Their research and planning ethic when looking at a business for one of their buyer-clients is second to none.  They will spend whatever time it takes to insure that all of the information needed to make a sound buying decision is made available to their clients and to us where we have been the accounting, valuation, tax and business advisors in a potential transaction.Buying a business is a major investment.  Buyers want to know that their agents and advisors always have their best interests at heart.  I have found Business Transfers and Strategies to be that ally and advocate that any potential purchaser would want to have on their side.”

           “Over the last two years I have worked on a number of transactions with Steve assisting his clients with their bank financing needs to purchase a business.  In my opinion, Steve has done an excellent job for his clients and the banks.  For his clients, he has sourced good companies at reasonable purchase prices in a number of different industries.  For the banks, he has helped explain the transaction and financing needs; coordinated and managed meetings between the client and the bank; and gathered the information needed by the bank to make its financing decision.  He also has developed a number of strong relationships with local banks, which has helped his clients find bank financing at competitive rates.”

           "Steve was the consummate professional in representing the buyer of my client’s business.  Time and again, Steve resurrected what appeared to be a 'dead deal' through his creativity, persistence and his deep experience in structuring transactions.  Without his guidance and level-headed approach, this deal simply would not have happened."

He has presented information regarding the business buying process to Keystone candidates interested in entrepreneurial ventures in both a group format and individually.

I would not hesitate to refer continual business to him.” - Cheri Paulson, Senior Vice President, Keystone Associates
